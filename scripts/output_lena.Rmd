## R Markdown

This is Lenas File. 
Isn't is beautiful? 
```{r }
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(ggplot2)

knitr::read_chunk(here("scripts", "load.R"))

```


```{r load}
```

the next chunk should be named as the file"chunk", but be entirely empty `knitr::read_chunk(here("scripts", "load.R"))`lets you use the code and displays the code of other scripts 

```{r}
ggplot(movies, aes(x = length, y = rating)) +
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(50, 300))  + 
  NULL
                    
```
